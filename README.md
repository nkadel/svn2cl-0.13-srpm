svn2cl-0.13-srpm
===============

SRPM tools for svn2cl, formerly in subversion-[version]-svn2cl

This package obsoletes subveson-svn2cl, which was a much older version
of the tool inside the subverson tarball and was locked to subversion
updates. The subverson maintainers have removed this and other
contributed tools, so the separate package is needed.

svn2cl obsoletes subversion-svn2cl.
